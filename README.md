# Hello, world!

# I am Abi

I’m the kind of programmer-for-fun who spends two years daydreaming about writing a microkernel or a music pseudocode language, fills notebooks with strange diagrams at 3am (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧, and eventually turns those ideas into real code because leaving them unfinished feels wrong.

Most of my projects come from the same place: curiosity, boredom, or a moment where I realise, *“this idea shouldn’t exist… but I’m going to make it anyway.”* (¯▿¯)

I tinker with embedded systems, microcontrollers, and small experimental environments.
Not professionally — just because I like watching small ideas become real.

## What I Actually Do

### Microcontrollers

I enjoy small, bare-metal, hands-on development.
Boards, pins, displays, strange peripherals — projects that begin as a scribble and somehow become hardware (•̀ω•́ )ゝ

### Microcontroller Operating Systems & Kernels

Not as an expert — more like a persistent hobbyist who refuses to let go of an idea.
My **Picomimi Kernel** is the best example: two years of imagining it, one year of trying to understand how real-time kernels work, and only recently (finally) writing it for real.

It’s small, strange, personal — and that’s exactly the point (¬‿¬)

### Quirky Side Projects

I have a habit of creating things that don’t need to exist, simply because I want them to.
**AbiMusicSheet (AMS)** is one of those: a human-readable “coded music sheet” language I invented because I can parse pseudocode instantly but can’t read piano notation to save my life (ಥ﹏ಥ)

I wrote it in a notebook long before coding it. Eventually, it escaped the notebook and became a real project (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ

Other ideas follow the same pattern: intrusive thought → evolution → solidification.

## My Development Style

My workflow confuses people because it looks inhuman on the contribution graph at times, and stagnates badly at other times (•_•)
It isn’t. It’s just how my brain works.

### Parallel Development

I don’t iterate linearly.
I develop multiple versions of a feature at the same time, each exploring a different behaviour.
They evolve separately, and then I selectively merge the strongest parts into a final design.

It’s essentially selective breeding, but for code — something borrowed from my plant hobby (´･ᴗ･ ` )
Only the fittest feature, or the most interesting survives.

### Documentation-Heavy

I update READMEs, comments, explanations, and phrasing more than I update code at times.
I rewrite obsessively until things feel clean and sensible.
This alone creates a suspicious amount of contributions ( T^T )

### Not AI-Driven

People sometimes assume the rapid contributions are automated.
They aren’t.

My concepts, quirks, designs, and project directions are completely human.
I only use AI for very narrow, technical areas I’m unfamiliar with (like the internals of MIDI files or merging complex feature branches cleanly).

When I use AI, it’s to *learn*, not to mass-produce code or impress anyone.
I disclose it because transparency feels more comfortable than hiding it (・‿・)

## Outside of Code

I like plants.
I’m a hobbyist grower, terrarium maker, and someone who finds comfort in ecosystems, soil, tiny worlds, woodworking, small electronics design, repairing laptops/phones, drawing, and painting.

My projects reflect that: small environments, controlled behaviour, careful iteration, slow evolution (•̀ᴗ•́ )و ̑̑

## Highlighted Repositories

### [Picomimi Kernel](https://github.com/MilkmanAbi/Picomimi)

A microcontroller OS / hobby kernel. Two years of imagining, one year of learning RTOS concepts, and finally brought to life. Small, experimental, and personal.

### [AbiMusicSheet](https://github.com/MilkmanAbi/AbiMusicSheet)

A human-readable, code-like music notation language for programmers. Started in a notebook, evolved into a real project. Fun, quirky, and completely unnecessary — just how I like it.

### [MilkWidgetCore](https://github.com/MilkmanAbi/MilkWidgetCore)

Successor and development experiment from GWidgetSuite. Random utilities and widgets, often bridging aesthetics and quirky experimental ideas. Shows my love for aesthetics.

## What You’ll Find in My Repos

* Minor microcontroller experiments
* Quirky programming languages like AMS
* Random widgets for aesthetics
* Iterative idea-evolutions
* Projects that exist simply because “it felt interesting enough to build” (￣▽￣)

If you’re looking for polished enterprise software, you won’t find it here.
If you’re looking for experimental ideas, strange directions, and weird lil projects born out of curiosity and stubbornness, this is where mine live.
